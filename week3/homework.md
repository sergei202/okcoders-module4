# Week 3 Homework

## Part 1

### Mongoose Populate
Read about [Mongoose Populate](https://medium.com/@nicknauert/mongooses-model-populate-b844ae6d1ee7) and make sure you understand how it works.

We stepped through an example of using `populate()` last week in the [Pet Store](https://github.com/sergei202/petstore) repo.
If that seemed hazy (or you were gone), go through the code and make sure you understand it.

## Part 2

### Heroku
- Read/do the [Heroku Node Tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction0)
- Create a simple Node/express app (Hello World or a counter) and upload to Heroku

#### Hints
- Don't forget that you must use the port that Heroku passes in `process.env.PORT`!
