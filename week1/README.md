## Intro to MongoDB and Mongoose

#### MongoDB and Mongoose
MongoDB is a [NoSQL](http://www.monitis.com/blog/cc-in-review-the-key-differences-between-sql-and-nosql-dbs/) database server.

Mongoose is a library that allows us to connect to MongoDB using NodeJS.

#### Installing MongoDB
Please read and install MongoDB for your laptop: [MongoDB Tutorials](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/).

If you run into problems, please ask me about them **BEFORE** Saturday's class!

#### MongoDB Tutorials
Please read [An Introduction to MongoDB](https://scotch.io/tutorials/an-introduction-to-mongodb) for a good intro and overview of what MongoDB is.


#### Robo 3T

Robo 3T is a GUI (Graphic User Interface) for MongoDB.  MongoDB comes with a commandline tool, but it is far from user-friendly.  Robo3T makes using MongoDB painless.

**Note:** We'll be using Mongoose for your *code* to talk to MongoDB.  You (the human) will be using Robo3T to view/edit/delete your MongoDB collections and documents.

Download it [here](https://robomongo.org/download).  **Note:** Download Robo 3T, **not** Studio 3T.


#### Mongoose

Finally, read/skim over [Mongoose's Getting Started](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) guide.
