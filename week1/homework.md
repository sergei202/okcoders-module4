# Homework - Week 1

## Part 1

Setup an Express server **FROM SCRATCH**.  Don't use or look at your old code unless you really get stuck.
I want you guys to get comfortable with Express and routes.  Doing it from scratch will get you there.

You will build:
- An express server (you can call this `part1.js` in a `week1` directory)
- Create a GET route that will increment a counter starting at 0
