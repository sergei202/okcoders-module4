# Homework - Week 2

# Part 1

Clone and install [mean-template](https://github.com/sergei202/mean-template).
This is a repo containing a fully functioning client/server MEAN example.

Your homework is to understand how it works.  We went over the server-side in class and ran out of time on the client-side.

The code is lightly commented, but still plenty to figure out.

Parts 2/3/4 will have you fork that repo and add on it, so please make sure you understand how it all works.

## Hints
- Everything in the repo is things we've done in class (throughout the modules)
- The Dummy model fields don't mean anything, don't try to abstract meaning from it, they are just examples
- As always, ask questions!
